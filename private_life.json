            "Hey guys, I just wanted to give a quick update on my marriage (or lack thereof)... Well, since $husband$ have been very distant lately, I have looked through his phone and other online accounts, and found that he has cheated on me quite a few times. Despite having perviously talked about it, he just keeps doing it. It is almost kinda impressive. Anyway, I have had enough. I don't want to go into detail of how I caught him doing the dirty deeds with $lady$, let's just say that we were all surprised. I am divorcing $husband$. Fittingly, todays recipe is $title$ which $husband$ absolutly hates, just as i hate him.",
            "Hi there, I just need to vent about my marriage today. No updates on my kids... Well, yesterday evening, when i was getting home from work, I found $husband$ naked in the living room with $lady$, looking all exhausted. $husband$ and $lady$ confess that it is far from the first time, and that they are secretly in love. Well now we are both looking into a divorce. I can't wait to get him out of the house. $lady$ seems nice though. Ill try to defer my mind with todays recipe $title$.",
            "OMG, I WILL FILE FOR DIVORSE! I know it looks like click-bait, but really I WILL. I just found out that every time $husband$ has claimed to be at the friday bar, he has secretly been cheating on me with $lady$! Im totally heartbroken. Only $title$ will get my mood up again.",
            "There I was, shopping for todays recipe, when I see $husband$ kissing with $lady$ just in the organic isle. They both seemed surprised, as if they don't know i always prefer organic! Anywho, I found out he, my pice-of-shit husband has been cheating on me with $lady$. Now im just waiting for the divorce papers to go though. Luckily I know that $husband$ hates $cooked_main$ and I will make sure he really can taste it tonight in $title$.",
            "Well, what a f*uckin day, $lady$ just called me and told me that she had been seeing my $husband$ privatley, naked, in her bed many times lately. That is just too much. I am filing for a divorce tomorrow! If your husband is ever claiming to have just been 'on a fishing trip' it is really just a cover for banging $lady$ on the side. Luckily, you are following my blog where good recipes makes you in a better mood. Todays mood-altering recipe is $title$."
